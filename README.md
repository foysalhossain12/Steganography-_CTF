    binwalk
    exiftool
    strings command
    stegsolver
    diit-1.5.jar

    sonic visualizer
    magic eye solver
    
    
### Steghide :

Steghide is one of the most famous steganography tools, and for good reason. It's a classic method, hiding a message inside an image, and steghide does it effectively and efficiently. A downside of steghide is that it only works on jpgs; however, that means that if you believe there is a hidden message inside a jpg, then steghide is a probable option.



One of the greatest benefits of stegohide, is that it can encrypt data with a passphrase. Meaning that if they don't have the password then they can't extract any data.



#### Note :steghide can be installed with the command üëÅÔ∏è
                                                         sudo apt install steghide
     
    Conclusion :
    
    steghide mainly use for extract or embeded file into .jpg file . But one can extract information from  audio / wav /mp3 file .
    So we can said that "Steghide  is  a  steganography  program  that  is able to hide data in various kinds of image- and audio-files"
    To embed emb.txt in cvr.jpg:
                                steghide embed -cf cvr.jpg -ef emb.txt
    To extract embedded data from stg.jpg:
                                          steghide extract -sf stg.jpg
     
    See details using man command (man steghide )
             
            
         
#### Note : Steghide can't extract .png format hide data 


### Stegoveritas :

### Zsteg :
zsteg is to png's what steghide is to jpg's. It supports various techniques to extract any and all data from png files.



### Note: zsteg also supports BMP files, but it is primarily used for png's.



##### zsteg can be installed by using ruby with the command:
                                                      gem install zsteg
       
### Command :
         
zsteg image.png
         
### Diit-1.5.jar :
diit-1.5.jar is so important tools for CTF contest . When all process fail to solve steganograhy challenge it come .
It use algorithm for extract data from image file
     
#### Command :
              java -jar diit-1.5.jar
              
### Stegsolver :
             stegsolver is another important tools for ctf . It change color combination and expose data from image .
             
#### Command :
 java -jar  stegsolver
             
Then , Choose target image and change color combination . If color changes system don't expose data you must click on  analyse button then choose option one by one . 

#### Note : You can combine two magic image for getting information uing stegsolver


### Magic eye solver:
                 magic eye solver is onle tools which is similar tools like stegsolver .It is mainly use for magic image .
                 



#### How to solve Challenge of Steganography ?

Ok  , no problem . Follow the given below process >>

### üëÄ Process for solving Steganography image  Challenges :

Step 1: check file type using  file command

Step2:use exiftool command 

Step3:use strings command

Step4:use steghide command if you have password for extract  otherwise use binwalk (But luckly you can try steghide without password)

Step5:zsteg tools 

Step6:open stegsolve.jar file using java ‚Äìjar stegsolve.jar ( then  , try to use it according to its uses )

Step7:use magic eye solver 

Step8:use diit-1.5.jar and try to extract information 

### üòç Process for solving Steganography wav  Challenges :

Step 1 :open  file and listen it .

Step 2 :If target audio file is morse code try to extract information using online morse code decode tools .If not , follow step 3

Step 3 :open sonic visualizer and try to extract information from it .

Step 4 : If above all step are failed . Try to extract data using  steghide as it has ability to extract audio file
